This code is for the coupled PML (Perfectly Matched Layer) three-dimensional magnetotelluric anisotropic parallel finite element forward modeling, which includes a single-frequency point parallel test case for model 3 (Figure 11 in the paper). The 'data' directory contains the input files, and the 'outfile' directory contains the output files, which output phase and apparent resistivity. Please note that due to time constraints, this code is only an initial version.  

# Getting Started
## Installation
Clone  
$ git clone https://github.com/  
$ cd PML

## Configure your environment
1、You will need to install the following external libraries:  
gcc9.3.0、mpich、superlu_dist-8.0.0、petsc-3.20.5 

2、Then you need to modify the make.inc file: 
BLAS_DIR     =/Your path/openmp  
LAPACK_DIR   =/Your path/gcc9.3.0  
PARMETIS_DIR =/Your path/parmetis-4.0.3  
METIS_DIR    =/Your path/metis  
SUPERLU_DIST =/Your path/superlu_dist-8.0.0  
EIGEN_DIR     =/Your path/eigen-git-mirror-master  
PETSC_DIR    =/Your path/petsc-3.20.5  

3、Compile your code    
$ make

4、Run your code  
$ sh mybatch.sh X1 X2 (X1 represents the number of nodes used at run time and X2 represents the total number of processes used at run time)  

$notice    
You need to select the mpi run command based on your environment, as shown below:  
mpiexe -n numpro(Number of processes) ./main
